                    <li>In tennis, points are scored in a unique way. Here's a breakdown of the point system:

                        1. Scoring Points in a Game:
                        
                        A player must win four points to win a game. The points progress as follows:
                        
                        0 points = "Love"
                        
                        1 point = "15"
                        
                        2 points = "30"
                        
                        3 points = "40"
                        
                        4 points = Game (if the player has at least a 2-point lead)</li>
                        
                        
                        For example, the score might go from 15-0, to 30-15, to 40-30, and then Game.
                        
                        <li>Deuce and Advantage:
                        
                        If both players reach 40-40, this is called a Deuce.
                        
                        To win from deuce, a player must win two consecutive points.
                        
                        The first point won after deuce gives a player Advantage.
                        
                        If the player with the advantage wins the next point, they win the game.
                        
                        If the opponent wins the next point, the score returns to Deuce, and this continues until one player wins two consecutive points.</li>
                        
                        
                        
                        3.<li> Winning a Set:
                        
                        A player must win 6 games to win a set, but they must win by at least 2 games.
                        
                        If both players win 6 games (6-6), a tiebreak is usually played to decide the set.</li>
                        
                        
                       <li> 4. Tiebreak:
                        
                        In a tiebreak, players alternate serves and the first player to reach 7 points (with a 2-point lead) wins the tiebreak and the set.
                        
                        Points in a tiebreak are scored numerically (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), unlike regular games.</li>
                        
                        
                        <li>5. Winning a Match:
                        
                        Matches are typically played as best of 3 sets or best of 5 sets, depending on the tournament.
                        
                        The first player to win the majority of sets (either 2 or 3) wins the match.</li>
                        
                        
                       <li> This structure makes tennis unique with its combination of games, sets, and matches.
